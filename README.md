# Summation of Squares Program

This Python script represents the given mathematical formula:

y = Î£(x^2), where x ranges from 1 to n

The user is prompted to enter the last number `n`. The script then calculates and prints the value of `y` based on the summation formula, where each term is the square of `x`. The loop iterates through the range from 1 to `n`, computing each term of the summation and updating the total sum. The final value of `y` is displayed as the result of the summation of squares.
